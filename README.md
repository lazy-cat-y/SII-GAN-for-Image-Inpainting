## Introduction 
Despite some promising results, it remains challenging for existing image inpainting approaches to fill in large missing regions in high resolution images (e.g., 512x512). We analyze that the difÔ¨Åculties mainly drive from simultaneously inferring missing contents and synthesizing fine-grained textures for a extremely large missing region. 
We propose a GAN-based model that improves performance by,
1) **Enhancing context reasoning by BDC Block in the generator.** The BDC blocks aggregate contextual transformations with different receptive fields, allowing to capture both informative distant contexts and rich patterns of interest for context reasoning. 
2) **Enhancing texture synthesis by SoftGAN in the discriminator.**  We improve the training of the discriminator by a tailored mask-prediction task. The enhanced discriminator is optimized to distinguish the detailed appearance of real and synthesized patches, which can in turn facilitate the generator to synthesize more realistic textures.

## Getting Started

1. Training:
    * Our codes are built upon distributed training with Pytorch.  
    * Run 
    ```
    cd src 
    python train.py  
    ```
2. Resume training:
    ```
    cd src
    python train.py --resume 
    ```
3. Testing:
    ```
    cd src 
    python test.py --pre_train [path to pretrained model] 
    ```
4. Evaluating:
    ```
    cd src 
    python eval.py --real_dir [ground truths] --fake_dir [inpainting results] --metric mae psnr ssim fid
    ```
